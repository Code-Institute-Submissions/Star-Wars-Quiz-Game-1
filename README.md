- Issues that came up.
    1. *userResultRef.innerHTML = mostRecentScore*  wouldnt read localStorage had to remove const variable and use localStorage.getItem("mostRecentScore");.

    2. *highScore* wouldnt read *mostRecentScore*variable and had to use localStorage.getItem("mostRecentScore"); assigned to it.

    3. *saveHighScore* function wouldnt pull data from localStorage > mostRecentScore and used again *localStorage.getItem("mostRecentScore");*.

    4. localStorage highScore wouldnt load without website refresh had to move it to *showScore* function to call it out.<details><summary>JavaScript code</summary>scoreListRef.innerHTML = highScore.map(score => {
        return `<li class="high-score">${score.name} - ${score.score}</li>`;
    }).join("")</details> 

    5. setInterval wouldnt reset while trying to play the game again, was moved outside and made to function with help of tutor support.

    6. Answer buttons were overlapping with footer on very old phones added *id btn-lower and margin-bottom: 5rem;* to it
